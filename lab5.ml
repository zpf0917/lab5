(*
Objective:

This lab provides practice with reference types and their use in
building mutable data structures and in imperative programming more
generally. It also gives further practice in using modules to abstract
data types.

(*====================================================================
Part 1: Fun with references

Consider a function inc that takes an int ref and has the side effect
of incrementing the integer stored in the ref. What is an appropriate
type for the return value? What should the type for the function as a
whole be? *)

   
(* Now implement the function. (As usual, for this and succeeding
exercises, you shouldn't feel beholden to how the definition is
introduced in the skeleton code below. For instance, you might want to
add a "rec", or use a different argument list, or no argument list at
all but binding to an anonymous function instead.) *)

let inc _ =
  failwith "inc not implemented" ;;

(* Write a function named remember that returns the last string that
it was called with. The first time it is called, it should return the
empty string.

    # remember "don't forget" ;;
    - : string = ""
    # remember "what was that again?" ;;
    - : string = "don't forget"
    # remember "etaoin shrdlu" ;;
    - : string = "what was that again?"

This is probably the least functional function ever written.

As usual, you shouldn't feel beholden to how the definition is
introduced in the skeleton code below. *)

let remember _ = 
  failwith "remember not implemented" ;;

Part 2: Gensym

The gensym function (short for "generate symbol") has a long history
dating back to the early days of the programming language LISP.  You
can find it as early as the 1974 MacLISP manual (page 53).
http://www.softwarepreservation.org/projects/LISP/MIT/Moon-MACLISP_Reference_Manual-Apr_08_1974.pdf

(What is LISP you ask? LISP is an untyped functional programming
language invented by John McCarthy in 1958, which he based directly on
Alonzo Church's lambda calculus. It is one of the most influential
programming languages ever devised. You could do worse than spend some
time learning the Scheme dialect of LISP, which, by the way, will be
made much easier by having learned a typed functional language --
OCaml.)

The gensym function takes a string and generates a new string by
postfixing a unique number, which is initially 0 but is incremented
each time gensym is called.

For example,

    # gensym "x" ;;
    - : string = "x0"
    # gensym "x" ;;
    - : string = "x1"
    # gensym "something" ;;
    - : string = "something2"
    # gensym (gensym "x") ;;
    - : string = "x34"

There are many uses of gensym, one of which is to generate new unique
variable names in an interpreter for a programming language. In fact,
you'll need gensym for just this purpose in completing the final
project for CS51, so this is definitely not wasted effort.

Complete the implementation of gensym. As usual, you shouldn't feel
beholden to how the definition is introduced in the skeleton code
below. (We'll stop mentioning this now.) *)

let gensym (s : string) : string = 
  failwith "gensym not implemented" ;;

(*====================================================================
Part 3: Appending mutable lists

Recall the definition of the mutable list type from lecture: *)

type 'a mlist = 
  | Nil 
  | Cons of 'a * ('a mlist ref) ;;

(* Mutable lists are just like regular lists, except that the tail of
each "cons" is a *reference* to a mutable list, so that it can be
updated.

Define a polymorphic function mlist_of_list that converts a regular
list to a mutable list, with behavior like this:

    # let xs = mlist_of_list ["a"; "b"; "c"];;
    val xs : string mlist =
      Cons ("a",
       {contents = Cons ("b", {contents = Cons ("c", {contents = Nil})})})

    # let ys = mlist_of_list [1; 2; 3];;
    val ys : int mlist =
      Cons (1, {contents = Cons (2, {contents = Cons (3, {contents = Nil})})})
 *)

let mlist_of_list (lst : 'a list) : 'a mlist =
  failwith "mlist_of_list not implemented" ;;

(* Define a function length to compute the length of an mlist. Try to
do this without looking at the solution that is given in the lecture
slides.

    # length Nil ;;
    - : int = 0
    # length (mlist_of_list [1;2;3;4]) ;;
    - : int = 4
 *)

let length (m : 'a mlist) : int = 
  failwith "length not implemented" ;;

(* What is the time complexity of the length function in O() notation
in terms of the length of its list argument? *)


(* Now, define a function mappend that takes a *non-empty* mutable
list and a second mutable list and, as a side effect, causes the first
to become the appending of the two lists. Some questions to think
about before you get started:

 o What is an appropriate return type for the mappend function? (You
   can glean our intended answer from the examples below, but try to
   think it through yourself first.)

#ifdef SOLN 
(* ANSWER: Since mappend is called for its side effect, unit is the
appropriate return type. An alternative would be to return some
indication as to whether the appending succeeded -- since it could
fail if the first argument is Nil -- perhaps as an option type. *)
#endif

 o  Why is there a restriction that the first list be non-empty?

#ifdef SOLN
(* ANSWER: The mlist type only allows tails of lists to be mutated, so
there is no way to mutate the empty list, and therefore no way to
append to it. *)
#endif

 o  What is the appropriate thing to do if mappend is called with an
    empty mutable list as first argument?

#ifdef SOLN
(* ANSWER: The return type of the function is unit, so there are only
two options: return () or raise an exception. Arguably, the latter is
a better choice, since an empty first argument is undoubtedly a sign
of the code having gone wrong. We show both implementations below. *)
#endif

Example of use:

    # let m1 = mlist_of_list [1; 2; 3];;
    val m1 : int mlist =
      Cons (1, {contents = Cons (2, {contents = Cons (3, {contents = Nil})})})

    # let m2 = mlist_of_list [4; 5; 6];;
    val m2 : int mlist =
      Cons (4, {contents = Cons (5, {contents = Cons (6, {contents = Nil})})})

    # length m1;;
    - : int = 3

    # mappend m1 m2;;
    - : unit = ()

    # length m1;;
    - : int = 6

    # m1;;
    - : int mlist =
    Cons (1,
     {contents =
       Cons (2,
        {contents =
          Cons (3,
           {contents =
             Cons (4,
              {contents = Cons (5, {contents = Cons (6, {contents = Nil})})})})})})
 *)

let mappend _ = 
  failwith "mappend not implemented" ;;

(* What happens when you evaluate the following expressions
sequentially in order?

# let m = mlist_of_list [1; 2; 3] ;;
# mappend m m ;;
# m ;;
# length m ;;

Do you understand what's going on? *)

(*====================================================================
Part 4: Adding serialization to imperative queues

In lecture, we defined a polymorphic imperative queue signature as
follows:

module type IMP_QUEUE =
  sig
    type 'a queue
    val empty : unit -> 'a queue
    val enq : 'a -> 'a queue -> unit
    val deq : 'a queue -> 'a option
  end

In this part, you'll add functionality to imperative queues to allow
converting queues to a string representation (sometimes referred to as
"serialization"), useful for printing. The signature needs to be
augmented first; we've done that for you here: *)

module type IMP_QUEUE =
  sig
    type elt
    type queue
    val empty : unit -> queue
    val enq : elt -> queue -> unit
    val deq : queue -> elt option
    val to_string : queue -> string
  end ;;

(* Note that we've changed the module slightly so that the element
type (elt) is made explicit.

The to_string function needs to know how to convert the individual
elements to strings. That information is best communicated by
packaging up the element type and its own to_string function in a
module that can serve as the argument to a functor for making
IMP_QUEUEs. (You'll recall this technique from lab 4.)

Given the ability to convert the elements to strings, the to_string
function should work by converting each element to a string in order
separated by arrows " -> " and with a final end marker to mark the end
of the queue "||". For instance, the queue containing integer elements
1, 2, and 3 would serialize to the string "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ||" (as
shown in the example below).

We've provided a functor for making imperative queues, which works
almost identically to the final implementation from lecture (based on
mutable lists) except for abstracting out the element type in the
functor argument. Your job is to complete the implementation by
finishing the to_string function. (Read on below for an example of the
use of the functor.)  *)

module MakeImpQueue (A : sig
                           type t
                           val to_string : t -> string
                         end)
       : (IMP_QUEUE with type elt = A.t) =
  struct
    type elt = A.t
    type mlist = Nil | Cons of elt * (mlist ref)
    type queue = {front: mlist ref ; rear: mlist ref}
    let empty () = {front = ref Nil; rear = ref Nil} 
    let enq x q = 
      match !(q.rear) with
      | Cons (_h, t) -> assert (!t = Nil);
                        t := Cons(x, ref Nil);
                        q.rear := !t
      | Nil -> assert (!(q.front) = Nil); 
               q.front := Cons(x, ref Nil);
               q.rear := !(q.front)
    let deq q = 
      match !(q.front) with
      | Cons (h, t) -> 
         q.front := !t ;
         (match !t with
          | Nil -> q.rear := Nil
          | Cons(_, _) -> ()); 
         Some h
      | Nil -> None
    let to_string q = 
      failwith "to_string not implemented"
  end ;;

(* To build an imperative queue, we apply the functor to an
appropriate argument. For instance, we can make an integer queue
module: *)

module IntQueue = MakeImpQueue (struct
                                  type t = int
                                  let to_string = string_of_int
                                end) ;;

(* And now we can test it by enqueueing some elements and converting
the queue to a string to make sure that the right elements are in
there. *)

let test () = 
  let open IntQueue in
  let q = empty () in
  enq 1 q;
  enq 2 q;
  enq 3 q;
  to_string q ;;

(* Running the test function should have the following behavior: 

# test () ;;
- : string = "1 -> 2 -> 3 -> ||"

*)
